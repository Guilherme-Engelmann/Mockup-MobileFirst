# TODO - Role-Based Access Control Implementation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Created login.php script for server-side authentication
- [x] Modified login form to submit to login.php
- [x] Added session-based authentication
- [x] Protected admin page (create.php) with session checks
- [x] Protected employee page (dashboardGeral.php) with session checks
- [x] Added logout functionality
- [x] Updated database schema for Usuarios table
- [x] Updated create.php to support user types and admin interface
- [x] Modified redirect logic: Admin -> create.php, Employee -> dashboardGeral.php

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test the authentication system
- [ ] Create sample admin and employee accounts in the database
- [ ] Ensure all pages are properly protected
- [ ] Add error handling for login failures
- [ ] Consider adding password reset functionality

## Notes
- Admin users are redirected to create.php (employee registration page)
- Employee users are redirected to dashboardGeral.php
- Logout destroys the session and redirects to login page
- Database connection uses localhost, root user, and tracktrain database
